                I am currently a Y2 student in SCIS SMU. My encounter with the field of IT was an unplanned one and it all
                started at Ngee Ann Polytechnic Open House. I came across a Financial Advice Capstone project done by a final year 
                students which I felt was very impactful and inspired me to take up IT. I want to learn skills that can be used to create
                meaningful applications that can benefit others. With math being one of my strengths, I chose to specialize in Business 
                Data Analytics. Through the various modules, I managed to gain exposure with Machine Learning algorithms such as Linear Regression,
                , Decision Trees and Neural Networks.
